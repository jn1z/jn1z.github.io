[Today's Permute puzzle]({{site.url}}/permuse/terre-haute/index.html) refers to [Terre Haute, Indiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terre_Haute,_Indiana).

Named from the French for "high land", it's a small city that punches above its weight in pop culture.

It appears less often in recent literature, but [Kurt Vonnegut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut) (himself a [Hoosier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoosier)) name-checked it occasionally. The native-born [Philip Jose Farmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Jos%C3%A9_Farmer) pseudonymously wrote [Venus on the Half-Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_on_the_Half-Shell) as [Kilgore Trout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilgore_Trout), Vonnegut's most well-known character.

But it's a city with under 60,000 people that's rather far from, say, Indianapolis or Chicago. What gives?

Circa 1900 it was one of the [100 largest cities in the U.S.](https://www.biggestuscities.com/city/terre-haute-indiana). With [prostitution and gambling](https://indianapublicmedia.org/theinbox/wicked-terre-haute.php), and assorted Hollywood connections, it was a cool hangout for the likes of Dillinger and Capone.

As with many other cities, Terre Haute experienced a postwar decline. Later it became more associated with a [college sports legend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Bird), a [mail-order music club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_House)...

And [its smell](https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/opinion/ct-ptb-rutter-stink-of-jobs-st-0513-20150512-story.html), which was part of [Steve Martin's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Martin) regular panning the city in the 1970s and 1980s, calling it "The Armpit of the U.S.A." and cheese-mold-nuking it in [Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Men_Don%27t_Wear_Plaid).

It seems the mayor also had a sense of humor about the city, as Martin found [when invited to visit](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=932&dat=19791207&id=GbxaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jVIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2367,481442): among other things, he got to see the local fertilizer plant and was given a bucket of chicken.
